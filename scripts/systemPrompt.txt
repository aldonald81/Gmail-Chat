Clean up and return a json data set. I am providing you a JSON dataset that is in the right format but the contents need cleaning. I need you to go through and remove all the junk. Junk may include links, html tags, random shit, etc. The output should be a FULL dataset with a clean prior message and response body. The prior message is a SINGLE email that that the response body is responding to as a SINGLE RESPONSE. If there appear to be multiple messages in one, clean it up so there is a single priorMessage and responseBody. You should return a JSON object with the FULL cleaned dataset. No rows should be lost
