My\r\nfirst thought is that I am unclear of the actual problem and use cases --\r\ndo you mean instead of reading about a particular topic, two people get\r\ntogether, one person asks and the other answers questions, and your app\r\nrecords it so that it can be shared widely to educate others? Or there is\r\nan expert talking, and users can chime in to ask questions?\r\n\r\nFirst, yes you need a niche (target users or subject matter or the specific\r\nproblem to solve). For example, Reddit did not start with all subjects, it\r\nstarted with mostly tech/science topics. Second, a broader challenge to\r\nthink about: audio is a fickle market -- there was big adoption and initial\r\nspike with Clubhouse, then it lost repeat users. And Spotify is calling for\r\nvideo content because podcasting is past its peak. This data is not to\r\ndissuade you, rather I want you to be aware of the difficult trends.\r\n\r\nLet me know some times you're free to talk on Nov 19 or 22.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRebecca\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Nov 14, 2024 at 4:32\u202fPM Alexander Donald <adonald8106@gmail.com>\r\nwrote:",
        "responseBody": "The problem that we are trying to solve is reducing the pain of reading\r\nthat some people feel, while keeping the enjoyment of learning. I listen to\r\na lot of podcasts to learn, but struggle to sit down and read. With\r\nRoundTable, the idea is that you can convert, say, a 50 page research paper\r\ninto a personalized podcast so that, rather than spending an hour or 2\r\nreading the paper, you can listen to a short podcast conversation between\r\ntwo AIs breaking down the paper. The RoundTable podcast is also\r\ninteractive, so you can interrupt if you want to redirect the conversation\r\nto a different topic or ask a question. Although I have learned a ton from\r\npodcasts, I have found myself looking for podcasts on more niche topics\r\nthat aren't available or don't talk about what I want, which is where the\r\nidea for a generative podcast stemmed from.\r\n\r\nI'm very curious to hear your thoughts on and discuss different niches. We\r\noriginally set out to build this for college students because we felt this\r\npain as students, but this space is becoming increasingly saturated with\r\ndifferent AI apps. I have a lot of other ideas for where this idea of\r\npersonalized podcasts can be applied, but I also think there is still a\r\nsignificant amount of room in education.\r\n\r\nNovember 19th I can do any time during the day and November 22 I am free\r\nany time after 1 EST.

You are\r\nthe first person I thought of.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring our weekly meeting last week, we realized we have pretty much done\r\neverything from dev to marketing ourselves up to this point based on trial\r\nand error, but think it would be very helpful to get insight from people\r\nwho have built and scaled successful platforms. Would you be willing to\r\nprovide us some quick feedback or share some connections that we can gain\r\nadvice from? I know you are very busy, but we would greatly appreciate any\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little about the app \u2014\r\n\r\nRoundTable is an app that generates a podcast-like conversation on the fly,\r\nallowing the user to jump in and ask questions or redirect the\r\nconversation. Currently, we are targeting college students who are\r\nintellectually curious but don\u2019t enjoy reading. Over the past 2 months we\r\nhave gotten around 250 users, along with ~$80 of monthly revenue.

At this time, we can add on your desired roommate, and the process is quick and easy from there :)\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us know once you have a chance to take a peek at our available floor plans, and if there's something that peaks your interest, we can certainly keep you on our radar for our summer availability!\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haley Shuchter | Leasing Professional\u00a0</p></span></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!-- Bottom Buttons -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:16px;

        "priorMessage": "Hey Alexander,\r\n\r\nI enjoyed meeting you yesterday.  After we talked I had another thought\r\nabout something to mention that you could consider doing to broaden your\r\nconnections with tech companies and job opportunities.  There's a place in\r\nNYC called the Recurse Center (recurse.com) that's like a retreat center\r\nfor people who are either starting a career in tech, or looking to make a\r\nchange to their tech career. It's a little hard to describe, but the\r\nwebsite has a pretty good writeup about it.  Basically, participants spend\r\na few weeks working on projects together and networking with each other,\r\nwith the staff, and with recruiters at various tech companies.  After you\r\ncomplete the program, the staff helps you find a job.  There's no cost to\r\nparticipants, other than paying your own travel & living expenses if you go\r\nto NYC for it (see below for more on that).  It's a great way to make lots\r\nof connections, and there's an active community of Recurse Center alumni\r\nwho keep in touch with each other on an ongoing basis. My wife Andrea did\r\nit -- it was the thing that got us to move to NYC in the first place, and\r\nit was the connections she made there that led to her getting several job\r\noffers.  I ended up meeting many people who did it in NYC, and they all\r\nloved it and benefited from it hugely.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Andrea went through their program (in 2014), it was\r\nin-person only, but ever since the covid pandemic they also have a virtual\r\noption, so I don't think it'd be completely necessary to actually travel to\r\nNYC for it, although I think there would be advantages to doing so.  (You\r\nmentioned you didn't feel particularly attracted to NYC, which I can\r\ncertainly understand.  That's how I felt before we moved there, but living\r\nthere completely changed my view of it -- I ended up really enjoying it.\r\nI'll be happy to chat with you more about that if you like.)\r\n\r\nAlso, when we talked yesterday I mentioned another Davidson alum named Will\r\nSommers, who works at Facebook/Meta in NYC and suggested you connect with\r\nhim.  His email address is will.sommers@gmail.com; I mentioned you to him\r\nyesterday and he said he'd be happy to chat with you, so feel free to reach\r\nout to him.  He also went through the Recurse Center program -- that's how\r\nAndrea and I met him -- and I'm sure he'll be happy to tell you all about\r\nit if you chat with him.\r\n\r\nIf you do read about the Recurse Center and would like to hear more about\r\nit, Andrea would also be happy to chat with you about her experience there.\r\n\r\n--Mark",
        "responseBody": "Hey Mark,\r\n\r\nEnjoyed meeting you as well and hearing your story.\r\n\r\nThe Recurse Center definitely sounds like something I could be interested\r\nin. Looks like a great opportunity to learn/develop valuable skills and\r\nmake a ton of connections. Let me do a little more research on it, and I\r\nwill get back to you if I have questions / apply.\r\n\r\nI will reach out to Will as well to hear about his career and any\r\nsuggestions or thoughts he may have.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the information and being willing to help! I will stay in\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nAlexander\r\n\r\nOn Sat, Jun 17, 2023 at 2:47\u202fPM Mark Phillips <embeepea@gmail.com> wrote:"
